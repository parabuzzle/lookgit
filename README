This is a server for administrating your git repos on your local network with a small to large development team.

The app comes in two flavors. 

 1. A lightweight camping implementation
 2. A robust rails implementation

CAMPING VERSION
Development on the camping version is reduced to a 'bug fix only' stage currently. The version requires the camping ruby gem
and works great. The interface is much like the GitWeb interface but is using ruby as the backend. There is no authentication
system and is meant for a small team of trusted individuals on a internal network.

RAILS VERSION
The Rails version is in early stages of development and is far more feature rich. The app designed for medium to large dev teams
and supports multiple levels of authentication and repository moderation. Repositories can be public or private and can be hosted
on a public internet server without threat to your private repositories.
